* Create a class called `Point` which has two instance variables,
`x` and `y` that represent the `x` and `y` co-ordinates respectively. 

* Initialize these instance variables in the `__init__` method

* Define a method, `distance` on `Point` which accepts another `Point` object as an argument and 
returns the distance between the two points.
